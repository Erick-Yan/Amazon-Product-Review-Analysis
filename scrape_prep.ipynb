       "  'review': 'I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13\" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13\" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don\\'t go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven\\'t done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That\\'s awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27\" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27\" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA\\'s camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone\\'s battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.

I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife.

I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Update:I saw some reviews that said their 3rd party usb hub broke their Mac. I\\'ve been using a usb-c to usb-a for a few weeks now with no problems (made by UNI). It\\'s worked for everything I threw at it; Logitech G910 keyboard, Razor mouse, Yamaha digital piano, RME Audio Interface, Roland A-49 midi keyboard. They all worked. I also have a cheapo Amazon Basics single usb adaptor cord about 6\" long, and it too works with everything on the MacBook.After decades of looking through Bill Gates\\' Windows, I bought my first Mac but only because of the new M1 chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. Applications optimized for the M1 now rival high end PCs (and for the first time too). I never was interested in Macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. Just don\\'t buy an earlier version of Macs, especially with Intel chips.Keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are NO upgrades later on; ZERO, NADA, nothing to change out. You can\\'t add RAM nor Storage once it\\'s built. (There is a workaround on storage, by adding an external SSD drive, but as I understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.)Also, SSD storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about 10% \\'headroom.\\' That is for example, if you have 256GB storage, you can only use 230GB as you need a 10% reserve to account for SSDs getting used up. It\\'s the nature of the beast. And of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. For my PC I bought a 250GB SSD and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so I replaced with a 1TB SSD and have already filled up half of it, but I don\\'t expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. It should be good for maybe a decade or so.So bottom line, get at least the 512GB storage or you\\'ll be sorry. It does kind of suck that Apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $200 in this case is worth it, IMHO. The jury is still out on if you need 16BG of RAM vs the 8GB models currently in stock, (Apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  If it was a PC, then getting 16GB RAM is a no-brainer, but in the case of the M1 chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. I have 32GB in my PC because RAM sticks are relatively cheap.Remember, once you buy a MacBook, it will stay as is. Upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway).',\n",

I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.Things I\\'m missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button. Notifications keep coming in upper right corner, blocking what I might want to access there. One needs to go through each app to change the setting btw, there\\'s no default to say do not show notifications. It would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up. I much prefer chrome to safari, though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power. I downloaded Flotata this morning which is supposed to help though I haven\\'t tried yet. Incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited, trying to figure things out!! Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn\\'t work. I haven\\'t purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding \"right-clicking\" with 2 finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as I\\'d expect it to.Overall unfortunately not a happy camper. Maybe for Mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason.I was also very torn whether to get the 8 or 16gb, I went with the 8. I don\\'t think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new.I also tried to have my teen daughter, who\\'s used to Macs, give me tips though she was\\'t terribly helpful so I watched a couple of YouTube vids which gave some guidance, things are not intuitive.I don\\'t like posting negative reviews, though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done, while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine, may find this helpful.Also as an fyi, I had to pay an additional nearly $300 to have my 2 external hard-drives transferred onto a new Mac compatible one, so I can access all my previous work.Wishing everyone better luck!',\n",

Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.The good things:Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must!  However, I couldn't imagine a new apple  computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!\",\n",

Only been a few days and I already see things unfamiliar I am learning. So far...I have to say the speed of the new M1 processor compared to any of the Windows 10 computers is very impressive and just the speed and \"faster response\" the MacBook seems to have combined with the programs I have downloaded and a few I purchased I would have to say I prefer the MacBook.  I added a 7 port USB hub and a trackball I use instead of the built in pad but other then that I have not changed a thing.  It definitely does everything I need it to do both business related an for pleasure.  I also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it\\'s first trip in just a few days.  If anyone is a current Windows user and is considering the switch to try out a MacBook I would say go for it and do not look back....If you purchase one and later decide you would prefer not to stick with it a MacBook seems to hold their value much better then the majority of Windows based computers out there.',\n",

I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.',\n",

They always mentioned that the Air wasn't very good, from 2011 all the way up to 2019, reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws MacBook Air had; from the thermal throttling, to the super small SSD (128 at base price), over $1000, then the Butterfly Keyboard etc. The list went on and on, and I really thought that it wasn't worth the money. Until, WWDC 2020, Apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home, I was so excited for this new generation, it reminded me of the time when they went from PowerPC to Intel. The excitement was there, and I loved the new unibody that started in 2016, with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average Joe. Everything was the same, but the new M1 chip. That is when I realized that this M1 MacBook Air was the one for me. I didn't hesitate and started saving until I had enough to buy it. And, I absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it. It is amazing, it's super slim. portable, super fast processing speed and power. The screen is beautiful, the bezels are unnoticeable. The keyboard is outstanding, To be completely honest, this laptop makes you want to be more productive, just because of its speed and its ease of use. If you're thinking about purchasing a Mac, this by far is one of the better choices (and the cheapest nonetheless) The charger is also outstanding! 30w is all you need for this little thing.\",\n",

But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren\\'t  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open.One process I use it for is livestreaming our church services using OBS, and iPhone and a USB Audio device for the feed from the mixer.  All of this is streamed only to FB Live and recorded on machine.  On the MBP, this all worked fine, but the battery couldn\\'t keep up, even plugged in.  Had the same issue on my 2018 MBP 13\".  But the M1 does all of this without any issues from a power perspective.  Plus, it\\'s much more stable for this use than the MBP.  I would get a lot of sticking video on the MBP and have, so far, received none on the M1.Very happy with the price too.  But, get as much memory and disk space as you can afford.  Can\\'t have too much.',\n",

I'm still having to learn a few things and had to Google questions on how to do somethings but it's been a good experience.  I really didn't expect that.  I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS.  I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS.  Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS.  Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram!  I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS!  I wish the screen was better though.  I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for.  Battery life is amazing! Camera quality sucks.  Come on Apple, give us the 2021 M1 iPad Pro camera and stop being so cheap!I'm happy with my purchase.  I will probably give this to my mom when the M2 MacBook Pro comes out!\",\n",

I\\'m your standard user looking for a dedicated, decent machine for work without breaking the bank.The M1 chip is supposed to be crazy fast compared to the previous version and yes, so far it is pretty good.  I use a graphic webpage called Canva and I am constantly getting a message telling me that it\\'s using excessive power & slowing my Macs performance down.  This even happens with Candy Crush..  I haven\\'t noticed any decrease in performance though.I also have the 2018 MacBook Air and it\\'s FaceTime video is FAR superior to this 2020 version which is very low quality and grainy.. I think my 2014 HP has a better quality video.  So if you\\'re looking for clear, crisp video for Zoom meetings you won\\'t find it here.  I mean really, I expected a LOT more from an Apple product.The power cord is not magnetic like the 2018, which to me was a much better design.  \"Someone\" is forever tripping over my cord and yanking it out which was fine with the 2018 version but this one will end up damaged if I can\\'t find a way to get it out of the way.  Small spaces are challenging :)I had to buy a compatible hub so that I could continue using my USB wireless mouse & flash drives since this MacBook Air only has 2 \"thunderbolt usb\" ports & one of them is for the power cord.  It\\'s not backwards compatible with all of my standard USB devices and no place at all for an SD card.I do LOVE the convenience fingerprint login/keychain feature.

I\\'m an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.I bought this one open box, that shouldn\\'t matter at all, and it doesn\\'t. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as \"like new\" condition with \"like new box\" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I\\'m happy to have the remainder.The latest Macbook I had was the 12\" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It\\'s solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather \"controversial\" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12\" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.One thing that didn\\'t work great for me-- maybe it\\'s me-- maybe it\\'s Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I\\'m able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven\\'t had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.',\n",

I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace\\'s gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any \"throttling\" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won\\'t run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit \"outdated\" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her \"prehistoric\" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850.',\n",

The only thing unexpected about it was the weight... the dimensions are smaller than the old macbook air my wife had, but heavier.

Google's chrome (native for the M1 processor) seg-faults quite a bit on this unit, though it has slowly been getting better as Google has updated the application to work better with the M1.  I do expect google will fix these issues over the next few weeks, it is a very new system after all and a new architecture target for chrome.

I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.\",\n",

I picked it up by the screen, and im a pretty tiny person.. and it like broke on the inside or something, the screen just shot out.. i wanted to just replace it for a new one But i would have had to go to the bank to put money in, because i guess you need the amount it would cost to do that. I was told that we would just do the refund, and i could rebuy it.. my refund seems to be taking a while, and it looks like the prices just went up on top of it. So im not very happy right now. i want to get the replacement. Def going to get the apple care plan (which also looks like it went up in price)  from like 2 days ago',\n",

The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade.

The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning.  Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things. But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook.\",\n",

Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it.

       "  'review': 'I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I\\'ve been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that\\'s to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it\\'s my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you\\'ll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that\\'s not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I\\'ve read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine \"has NO USB PORTS!!!\", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that\\'s easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I\\'ll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I\\'m very happy with my purchase and would do it again.',\n",

THIS THING IS QUIET !!!Keyboard: No more butterfly keyboard!Cons: Apple got the same deal for student but they attach FREE airpod so sadly I have to return this to amazon so I can that dealSmuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but I guess it is what it is.All in all, I highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this. I was always a window users except for my Iphone and I also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this M1 laptop right here beat everything else at this price point.\",\n",

(although this may not be a good part of the review as this is kinda based off of the buyers opinion(s))tldr: the battery is very very good. long lasting. the screen is also very pleasing to look at. the colors truly do show themselves on this laptop and the brightness control is also very nice to have. the keyboard is very nice quality and sounds nice and feels nice to type on. teh speakers almost act as surround sound because they are on both sides of me and have a very nice output of the sound. lastly, the design is sleek and minimalistic and i love that.oh and did i mention that the touch pad is also very nice. its like the home button on the iphone 7 and 8. it doesnt actually click it just feels like it which i happen to like too',\n",

Way longer than I expected. it also charges real quick. Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge, it can be plugged in at any USB C plug. The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports. No SD or micro SD reader. I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac, just had to download free software from Seagate. The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that don't have a USB C plug. But this MacBook Air is super cool. The camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality. I have not even had a need to use my external Blue mic yet.\",\n",

Before the 30-day return window was up, I brought it to the apple store (twice).  The Apple Store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. The store claimed “damage” was done to the laptop.  An unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. This is a defect, not “damage”.  Additionally, employee at the Apple Store, said that he could only “swap it out” if we purchased it from Apple directly.  This is unacceptable, I purchased this unit from Amazon which is an authorized Apple Retailer.  The same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.The screens on the M1 MacBook Airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  Apple won’t stand behind its product and fix it. Amazon will take back the laptop and I’m getting a full refund.  Apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  The M1 MacBook Air has poor components, poor warranty and the Apple staff are not handling these issues well.  Apple is blaming customers for Apple’s poor build quality.',\n",

The new one has already been repaired because of the track pad a a few keys sticking the track pad is awful as you can hover over it and it engages and sends without touching it and when you want to send it sometimes takes several clicks. Changing the settings causes it to slow down and delay transmission and there isn't a happy medium.  I have become used to it but when traveling in a car or plane it's obviously flawed. also upload / receiving times a mediocre at best score.

       "  'review': \"Update 09/01/21:Still going strong!Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs. This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.\",\n",

I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen.\",\n",

I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been using Mac laptops for 30 years (yes before there were Macbooks) and this is my favorite yet.With this Macbook Air I'm coming from an 8 year old MacBook Pro. In comparison, it is:Super light. Feels like carrying a book.Great feeling keyboard.Fast.Excellent battery life.Beautiful display.Overall, I am more productive and happy since I started using this MacBook Air!(When I first got it there were some bugs but perhaps they fixed them in Big Sur. It's been 3 months now, smooth sailing.)CONS:I hate Apple so much for changing the USB port. You need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old USB cord to work. I bought a beautiful cover for my MacBook but they didn't plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so I have to take the shell off. Did I say I hate Apple for doing this?\",\n",

Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it.\",\n",

Até o momento (quase 2 meses de uso) já trabalhei com Java, Python e C. Dessas linguagens, tive problemas com algumas bibliotecas muito específicas de C e só. Java e Python funcionaram 10/10 sem nenhuma \"bruxaria\" feita por trás dos panos.Also, uso o Intellij IDEA + VSCode, e ambos vem funcionando incrivelmente bem, zero travamentos ou delays, nadinha. Completamente perfeitos.Quanto ao uso de estudante, é mais Word/OneNote/Chrome, e a experiência também é maravilhosa. Nada de problemas, nada de delays, nada de erros, nada de nada. Somente sorrisos e alegrias.Inclusive, adquiri o CleanMyMac, que recorrentemente me lança um warning dizendo \"opa, tua memória (8GB) tá no limite, libera um pouco aí\" e mesmo eu ignorando totalmente esse warning, o sistema continua rodando completamente lisinho, rápido, alternando entre quantos apps eu quiser (IntelliJ, Postman, Chrome, SQLWorkbench...), de forma que minha experiência não foi nadinha comprometida. O único problema que pode vir a rolar é com Docker, mas por mais que eu tenha instalado, ainda não subi nenhum container pra fazer o teste, então não sei dizer.Em resumo -> comprem sem medo, é perfeito.',\n",

Vale muito a pena. Depois de tentar inúmeras vezes em outras lojas e ter diversos problemas com a transação, a amazon foi a única empresa que foi incrivelmente rápida com a resposta e aprovação. No dia seguinte o vendedor enviou, e como precisava rapidamente para continuar o meu trabalho, chegou em dois dois aproximadamente.Vamos lá: acho que merece uma avaliação extensa.O processador M1 equivale a um intel I9. se o uso for mt pesado recomendo pegar o de 512 gb/16 gb ram. O meu de 8 está segurando bem. Utiliso obs estudio, faço streaming, mas n trabalho com cinema ou coisas que demandem muitas edições pesadas.10- A bateria me surpreendeu. Demora muito pra descarregar. Autonomia de 10 horas. Acima do normal. ( Todas essas impressões se aplicam há uma semana)10- teclado. Delicioso de teclar. Recomendo colocar proteção por ser um apple. Nada se consegue modificar muito.10- design. NUNCA vi algo tão fininho. Leve e o tamanho é perfeito se vc quer mobilidade.Pontos negativos:Alguns app nativos você não consegue deletar ( ocupa a memória)Obsolescência programada gigante ( money)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>N recomendo instalar todas as atualizacoes que eles mandam antes de 6 meses. Verifique antes. Pesquise. Eles ja me mandaram algo e eu ainda n fiz.Peças soldadas, pelo que pesquisei não é possível aumentar a memória dele. caso o meu uso aumente a demanda vou precisar trocar. ( Capitalista, porém n é só algo dessa empresa em si. Vale a pena o investimento mas pense bem e faça muita pesquisa e testes baseados no seu uso)USB - o usb dele é o novo. Prepare o bolso pra gastar entre 100/200 pilas pra comprar um hub com umas 4 ou 5 usbs se seu uso for intenso. Tem outros mais baratos mas n vi nadaconfiável por menos de 90.Vendedor ótimo, gostaria de agradecer muito. Mudou meu trabalho e sou eternamente grata. Estou deixando logo a avaliação pra que vc possa receber tudo o quanto antes. Só me preocupo se perco algo deixando antes do tempo? Acho que não né, estou usando e por enquanto te sendo ótimo. Sou muito cuidadosa. Bom, de toda forma é uma máquina linda e potente. Pra um uso leve/moderado.Se vc acha que vc precisa investir em algo, vai colher bons frutos. Mas pesquise se esse modelo é o exato.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I needed a new laptop quickly after I accidentally drowned my previous MacBook Air (reached for a bottle of water without taking my eyes off the screen, didn't realize the bottle was uncapped, and...sploosh! One waterlogged keyboard, plus one soaked and angry cat who'd been napping peacefully beside me on the couch.) Ordered this one quickly on someone else's computer and it arrived the next day. I'm no computer genius and am way older than the generation that grew up with assorted devices in their hands from babyhood, so there are still a lot of things I haven't figured out how to do. But I quickly (for me) got the new one filling my basic needs, and am working on what else it can do.Not a very useful review for those who want technical details, sorry! More of a reassurance that if you need a laptop that is user-friendly when you're not a knowledgeable user, this one will do the job nicely.\",\n",

Quanto ao computador não tenho nem o que dizer, já é meu terceiro MacBook Air, desde 2011 e ainda tenho os outros dois sendo usados pelos meus filhos, quase sem nenhum problema, que  mesmo quando aparecem são coisas pequenas e plenamente resolvidos pelas assistência técnica on-line, que tem os melhores atendentes que já vi na vida. O preço continua sendo alto demais para o Brasil, mas frente aos outros no mercado, vale cada centavo suado gasto. Esse modelo é ágil, tem como novidade touch para senhas e o teclado é maravilhoso. Super rápido o processador e a memória de 8Gb era o que faltava pra mim, pois dando aulas on-line uso muitos programas conectados ao mesmo tempo e meu MacBook antigo com 4Gb não estava conseguindo dar conta. Mas será perfeito pra minha filha que não usará poucos programas. Já era e continuo sendo fã total, melhores compras sempre são dos produtos Apple.

Migrei do Windows para Mac e em primeiro momento acaba sendo um pouco complicado, muitos atalhos conhecidos são diferentes o que te faz ficar um pouco perdido, mas tudo é bem intuitivo para facilitar a adaptação, ainda mais se já for um usuário de outros produtos Apple. O trackpad é ótimo com os gestos, autonomia de bateria dispensa comentários. Não testei para jogos e apps mais pesados, por enquanto apenas em uso comum então não posso opinar muito apropriadamente sobre o sistema de refrigeração, mas para meu uso, não senti o notebook esquentando. Em resumo (e lembrando, minha opinião PESSOAL): se você tem condições de adquirir uma máquina desta mesmo que seu intuito não seja uso mais profissional (ou seja, na contramão do que a maioria diz ser o \"correto\"), ainda acredito que vale a pena pela portabilidade, fluidez do sistema e bateria, além das atualizações e suporte garantidos pelos próximos vários anos. O que enxergo de negativo é o preço, mas ultimamente nada está \"barato\" e a longo prazo o custo acaba se pagando.',\n",

O trackpad e unico, ninguém consegue chegar perto nesse quesito, a tela e extremamente nítida e vibrante em cores, o teclado e confortável, e a experiencia de um modo geral no MacOS e infinitamente melhor do que na porcaria do Windows, seja para trabalhar ou um uso mais comum.Recomendo o produto com todas as letras, valeu a pena cada centavo.',\n",
