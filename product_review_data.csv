Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.","Beautiful laptop.

1,r2xa6kr3rqgrma,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.

3,r1mdj8zt1bgs62,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.

I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color.

7,r25lsfbr6a6mz,"I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more ""fancy"" than other options on the market.With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family.

9,r1mwmtk0j1ay1q,"I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done.","I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back.

10,r3sfw6jkm9ydz1,"I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.","I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career.

I also have a cheapo Amazon Basics single usb adaptor cord about 6"" long, and it too works with everything on the MacBook.After decades of looking through Bill Gates' Windows, I bought my first Mac but only because of the new M1 chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. Applications optimized for the M1 now rival high end PCs (and for the first time too). I never was interested in Macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. Just don't buy an earlier version of Macs, especially with Intel chips.Keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are NO upgrades later on; ZERO, NADA, nothing to change out. You can't add RAM nor Storage once it's built. (There is a workaround on storage, by adding an external SSD drive, but as I understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.)Also, SSD storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about 10% 'headroom.' That is for example, if you have 256GB storage, you can only use 230GB as you need a 10% reserve to account for SSDs getting used up. It's the nature of the beast. And of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. For my PC I bought a 250GB SSD and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so I replaced with a 1TB SSD and have already filled up half of it, but I don't expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. It should be good for maybe a decade or so.So bottom line, get at least the 512GB storage or you'll be sorry. It does kind of suck that Apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $200 in this case is worth it, IMHO. The jury is still out on if you need 16BG of RAM vs the 8GB models currently in stock, (Apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  If it was a PC, then getting 16GB RAM is a no-brainer, but in the case of the M1 chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. I have 32GB in my PC because RAM sticks are relatively cheap.Remember, once you buy a MacBook, it will stay as is. Upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway).","Update:I saw some reviews that said their 3rd party usb hub broke their Mac.

I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.Things I'm missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button.

Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn't work.

They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break.  The MacBook Air is no exception to this.  The SSD is solider to the motherboard.  Likewise the RAM.  Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again?

31,r37fopeh3lwa3f,"I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.","I love this little computer!

32,r3v2omx8vxrqhn,I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer.

Just the fact that it lasted me 10+ years shows its value. It is worth it. Once you go Mac, you never go back. ;)",English,5.0,8.0,2021-02-22,Capacity: 512GBColor: Gold,512GB,Gold

You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way.","What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none.

85,rgddnqt5kznk6,"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.","I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).

Al final me di cuenta que estaba equivocado. Una cosa segura es que te puedas comprar una PC con mejores especificaciones a este precio, pero la belleza y lo fino que son estas MacBook y el sistema operativo, hace que, aunque suene raro, las especificaciones queden un poco de lado.

874,rnvns9kp2emaf,"Update 09/01/21:Still going strong!Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs. This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.","Update 09/01/21:Still going strong!Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs.

I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls.

876,r3ahlootvca8wc,"I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.","I love everything Apple did to update the Air.

The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.",English,5.0,,2020-12-11,Capacity: 256GBColor: Space Gray,256GB,Space Gray
877,rv3wto09cbgd3,"This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.","This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads.

   Amei! Vale muito a pena. Depois de tentar inúmeras vezes em outras lojas e ter diversos problemas com a transação, a amazon foi a única empresa que foi incrivelmente rápida com a resposta e aprovação. No dia seguinte o vendedor enviou, e como precisava rapidamente para continuar o meu trabalho, chegou em dois dois aproximadamente.Vamos lá: acho que merece uma avaliação extensa.O processador M1 equivale a um intel I9. se o uso for mt pesado recomendo pegar o de 512 gb/16 gb ram. O meu de 8 está segurando bem. Utiliso obs estudio, faço streaming, mas n trabalho com cinema ou coisas que demandem muitas edições pesadas.10- A bateria me surpreendeu. Demora muito pra descarregar. Autonomia de 10 horas. Acima do normal. ( Todas essas impressões se aplicam há uma semana)10- teclado. Delicioso de teclar. Recomendo colocar proteção por ser um apple. Nada se consegue modificar muito.10- design. NUNCA vi algo tão fininho. Leve e o tamanho é perfeito se vc quer mobilidade.Pontos negativos:Alguns app nativos você não consegue deletar ( ocupa a memória)Obsolescência programada gigante ( money)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>N recomendo instalar todas as atualizacoes que eles mandam antes de 6 meses. Verifique antes. Pesquise. Eles ja me mandaram algo e eu ainda n fiz.Peças soldadas, pelo que pesquisei não é possível aumentar a memória dele. caso o meu uso aumente a demanda vou precisar trocar. ( Capitalista, porém n é só algo dessa empresa em si. Vale a pena o investimento mas pense bem e faça muita pesquisa e testes baseados no seu uso)USB - o usb dele é o novo. Prepare o bolso pra gastar entre 100/200 pilas pra comprar um hub com umas 4 ou 5 usbs se seu uso for intenso. Tem outros mais baratos mas n vi nadaconfiável por menos de 90.Vendedor ótimo, gostaria de agradecer muito. Mudou meu trabalho e sou eternamente grata. Estou deixando logo a avaliação pra que vc possa receber tudo o quanto antes. Só me preocupo se perco algo deixando antes do tempo? Acho que não né, estou usando e por enquanto te sendo ótimo. Sou muito cuidadosa. Bom, de toda forma é uma máquina linda e potente. Pra um uso leve/moderado.Se vc acha que vc precisa investir em algo, vai colher bons frutos. Mas pesquise se esse modelo é o exato.","Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 0:00Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time -0:00 Playback Rate1xChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions and subtitles off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.



  I loved! It's really worth it. After trying numerous times at other stores and having several issues with the transaction, amazon was the only company that was incredibly quick with response and approval. The next day the seller sent it, and as I needed it quickly to continue my work, it arrived in two or two approximately. Here we go: I think it deserves an extensive evaluation. The M1 processor is equivalent to an intel I9. if the use is mt heavy I recommend getting the 512 gb/16 gb ram. My 8 is holding up well. I use obs studio, I do streaming, but I don't work with cinema or things that demand a lot of heavy editing.10- The drums surprised me. It takes a long time to download. 10 hours autonomy. Above normal. (All these prints apply for a week)10- keyboard. Delicious to type. I recommend putting protection for being an apple. Nothing can be changed much.10- design. I have NEVER seen anything so thin. Lightweight and size is perfect if you want mobility. Negative points: Some native apps you can't delete (takes up memory) Giant programmed obsolescence ( money)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I don't recommend install all updates they ship before 6 months. Please check before. Search. They've already sent me something and I haven't done it yet. Welded parts, from what I've researched, it's not possible to increase his memory. if my use increases the demand I will need to change. (Capitalist, but it's not just something from this company itself. It's worth the investment but think carefully and do a lot of research and testing based on your usage) USB - his usb is the new one. Prepare your pocket to spend between 100/200 dicks to buy a hub with about 4 or 5 usbs if your use is intense. There are other cheaper ones but I haven't seen anything reliable for less than 90. Great seller, I would like to thank you very much. It changed my job and I am eternally grateful. I'm leaving the evaluation soon so you can receive everything as soon as possible.

Migrei do Windows para Mac e em primeiro momento acaba sendo um pouco complicado, muitos atalhos conhecidos são diferentes o que te faz ficar um pouco perdido, mas tudo é bem intuitivo para facilitar a adaptação, ainda mais se já for um usuário de outros produtos Apple. O trackpad é ótimo com os gestos, autonomia de bateria dispensa comentários. Não testei para jogos e apps mais pesados, por enquanto apenas em uso comum então não posso opinar muito apropriadamente sobre o sistema de refrigeração, mas para meu uso, não senti o notebook esquentando. Em resumo (e lembrando, minha opinião PESSOAL): se você tem condições de adquirir uma máquina desta mesmo que seu intuito não seja uso mais profissional (ou seja, na contramão do que a maioria diz ser o ""correto""), ainda acredito que vale a pena pela portabilidade, fluidez do sistema e bateria, além das atualizações e suporte garantidos pelos próximos vários anos. O que enxergo de negativo é o preço, mas ultimamente nada está ""barato"" e a longo prazo o custo acaba se pagando.","Very good computer. I migrated from Windows to Mac and at first it ends up being a little complicated, many known shortcuts are different which makes you a little lost, but everything is very intuitive to facilitate adaptation, especially if you are already a user of other Apple products .

I haven't tested it for games and heavier apps, so far just in common use so I can't really opine very properly on the cooling system, but for my use, I didn't feel the notebook warming up. In summary (and remembering, my PERSONAL opinion): if you are able to purchase a machine of this even if its purpose is not more professional use (that is, contrary to what most say is ""correct""), I still believe that it's worth it for the portability, fluidity of the system and battery, plus the updates and support guaranteed for the next several years.

Mandei mensagem pra eles pedindo se poderiam me ajudar, enviando o mais rápido possível, e pra minha surpresa eles responderam na hora, agilizando o processo e a entrega. Chegou em 3 dias úteis, a partir da data da compra, se não me engano. O motoboy só entregou o produto quando EU desci, com documento em mãos, e assinei pela entrega.

Sim. Mas se você precisa do computador como ferramenta de trabalho, como eu, vale cada centavo.","First I wanted to talk about the seller who was SUPER attentive to me.
